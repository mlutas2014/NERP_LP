Hi! 

 I've just found a document in MSDN which describes how to deploy application with COM included without a need to globally register activeX control. In short: 
 - after the reference to AxMapWinGIS has been added to "References" node (in Solution Explorer), you should select this item and set "Isolated" property in Properties window to TRUE. 

 When you rebuild the solution and go to "bin" folder you will see that ".ocx" file is there. It says in MSDN that this technique works only for XP or higher OS (which is enough for everyone I think :)
